# glycemic_spectrum

This is a python program that I used Bing AI to generate with the following prompt:

Graph the estimated average blood glucose levels in mg/dl associated with the spectrum of hba1c from 4.5 - 9.0 using python, pandas, and matplotlib. Use increments of .1 in the pandas dataframe. Use fill_between method to plot area under curve below 6.0 in blue and area above curve above 7.0 in red.

After generating it, I edited it to suit as you see here. It was close. Not perfect. Like Zach Bitter's ketogenic diet that allows him to dominate 100 mile ultramarathons.
